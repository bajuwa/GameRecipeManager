A python script that uses text files to store and discover information about items and simple recipes while playing games.<br>
An example recipe can be taken from the N64 Paper Mario game: Honey + Mushroom = HoneyShroom<br>
Each game (with its corresponding item and recipe information) is stored as a text file in human readable format that can be browsed outside of the program if necessary
